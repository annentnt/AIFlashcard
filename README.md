## Installation

### <a name="front-end-setup"></a>Front-end Setup

```bash
cd client/memoria
npm install
npm run dev
```
> The front-end is built with Next.js (React). It uses TailwindCSS and Hero UI for styling and UI components.

### <a name="back-end-setup"></a>Back-end Setup

```bash
cd server
pipenv shell
pipenv sync
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
> The back-end uses Django and Django REST Framework. Make sure your database is set up before running migrations.

### <a name="database-setup"></a>Database Setup

- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Create a new database (e.g., `memoria`), user, and password.
- Update your database settings in `server/settings.py`:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'memoria',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```
- Install PostgreSQL drivers for Python if prompted (`pipenv install psycopg2`).

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload Document:**  
   User uploads a DOCX, PPTX, PDF, or text document and sets the desired number of flashcards.
2. **Flashcard Extraction:**  
   Front-end sends the file to the back-end, which calls the ChatGPT API for vocabulary extraction and risk filtering.
3. **Review & Edit:**  
   Extracted flashcards are displayed. User can edit cards before saving.
4. **Save to Topic:**  
   Finalized flashcards are saved as a topic in the user’s collection.
5. **Learning Session:**  
   Users select a topic and learn using swipe/flip UI, check IPA/pronunciation, and interact with the QnA chatbot.
6. **Progress Tracking:**  
   System maintains history of learned/unlearned words for each topic.
